# 5. Exploring Logical Operations and Precedence
# Objective: The aim of this assignment is to grasp the concept of logical operations and understand how operator precedence can affect the outcome of an operation.

# Task 1: Validating Calculations Calculate the value of a particular arithmetic expression twice: once normally, and once using parentheses. Compare the two results to see if they match.
print("10+9*8 = ", 10+9*8)
print("(10+9)*8 = ", (10+9)*8)

# Task 2: Mix and Match Combine arithmetic (+), logical (or), and comparison (>) operators in a single expression and predict the outcome. Then, compute the expression to see if the prediction was correct.
# 2 > 1+1 or 1+1==2 and 1>2 should be True
print("predict the outcome 2>1+1 or 1+1==2 and 1>2 should be True")
print("Actually the outcome 2>1+1 or 1+1==2 and 1>2 outcome is ", 2 > 1+1 or 1+1==2 and 1>2)
