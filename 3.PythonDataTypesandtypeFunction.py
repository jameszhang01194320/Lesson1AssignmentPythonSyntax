# 3. Python Data Types and type() Function
# Objective: The aim of this assignment is to practice identifying and using Python's basic data types, as well as the type() function for checking a variable's data type.

# Task 1: Code Correction Given below are some variable assignments. Your task is to identify the data type of each variable and then use the type() function to print it out:
# variable_a = "Hello, World!"
# variable_b = 23
# variable_c = 3.14
# variable_d = True

# Answer:
variable_a = "Hello, World!"
variable_b = 23
variable_c = 3.14
variable_d = True
print(f"Data type of variable_a: {type(variable_a)}")
print(f"Data type of variable_b: {type(variable_b)}")
print(f"Data type of variable_c: {type(variable_c)}")
print(f"Data type of variable_d: {type(variable_d)}")
